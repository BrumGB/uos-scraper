Our students have had placements working on new particle accelerators and nuclear waste management at government laboratories, and on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, before finishing their degree as part of a research team here in Sheffield.</p>\n\n<p>At the start of your course, you’ll cover the essential physics behind everything else you’ll study: heat, motion, electricity, magnetism and quantum mechanics.You’ll learn through lectures and practical labs so you won’t be learning about abstract topics in isolation. You’ll run experiments using the equipment in our modern laboratories to help you understand how important theories apply to the real world.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll explore essential physics in even more depth in the second year, and choose from options where you can learn how stars and galaxies are structured, how particles are detected or the physics of music. Programming classes will teach you skills that are valuable in many graduate careers, from data science to computer game design.</p>\n\n<p>Your third year will be your placement year. When you return to Sheffield for your fourth year, you can branch out into lots of different areas and complete your own research project in physics. Your core modules will cover topics like particle physics, nuclear physics and semiconductor technologies. Options include topics such as cosmology, mathematical physics and enterprise.</p>\n\n<p>A variety of optional modules are also available in your final year, when you’ll also be working on a major research project. You’ll choose a research topic in physics and work closely with a member of academic staff who is an expert in the area you want to explore. The project takes up around half of your final year and can lead to a publication in a scientific journal.</p>\n\n<div data-embed-button=\"paragraph\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:paragraphs_library_item.embed\" data-entity-type=\"paragraphs_library_item\" data-entity-uuid=\"11fe429b-1a81-461a-bf0e-cac3096118f4\" data-langcode=\"en\" class=\"embedded-entity\"><!-- <h1>Library item label woz ere</H1> -->\n        \n  <div class=\"uosblock textbox\">\n          \n        <section class=\"block block-layout-builder block-field-blockparagraphpara-text-boxfield-tb-body\"><p><a class=\"uosbutton\" data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"4ee6b0c1-d044-4ec1-ab9e-ec66a23e3e70\" href=\"/undergraduate/visit/open-days\" title=\"Open days\">Book an open day</a></p>\n    \n    \n    \n  </section></div>\n\n    </div>\n\n\n          \n\n    \n          \n\n    \n        \n                    \n        <div id=\"accreds\" class=\"accred\">\n        <p>Accredited by the Institute of Physics (IOP) for the purpose of fully meeting the educational requirement for Chartered Physicist.</p>\n</div>\n\n      \n    \n      <div class=\"accreds\">\n        \n        \n    \n        \n    <a href=\"https://www.iop.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"accbody\" title=\"\">\n                      <div class=\"media--image--figure\">\n  \n    <figure class=\"imgcapt\">\n                  <picture>\n                  <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_256px_x_144px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=8CDOqqDf 256w, /sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_512px_x_288px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=haaw23Vn 512w\" media=\"all and (min-width: 1920px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1920px) 10vw, 256px\">\n              <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_256px_x_144px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=8CDOqqDf 256w, /sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_512px_x_288px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=haaw23Vn 512w\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 1280px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 15vw, (max-width: 1280px) 16vw, 256px\">\n              <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_256px_x_144px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=8CDOqqDf 256w, /sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_512px_x_288px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=haaw23Vn 512w\" media=\"screen and (min-width: 1024px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1024px) 20vw, 256px\">\n              <source srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_128px_x_288px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=benYTVQt 128w, /sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_256px_x_144px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=8CDOqqDf 256w\" type=\"image/jpeg\" sizes=\"32vw\">\n                  <img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/responsive_thumbnail_128px_x_288px_/public/2022-03/iop.png.jpg?itok=benYTVQt\" alt=\"Institute of Physics logo\">\n\n  </picture>\n\n\n    \n            </figure>\n  </div>\n\n    \n          <span>        Institute of Physics (IOP)\n    </span>\n    </a>\n\n    </div>\n\n              <div>\n  \n    <figure class=\"imgcapt\" name=\"PHY Modelling unemployment with Physics and Computer Programming\">  \n            <div data-video-embed-field-lazy=\"<div class=&quot;video-embed-field-provider-YouTube video-embed-field-responsive-video&quot;><iframe width=&quot;854&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cplK81BHhZM?autoplay=1&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;rel=0&quot;></iframe>\n</div>\n\" class=\"video-embed-field-lazy\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/two_thirds_1x/public/video_thumbnails/cplK81BHhZM.jpg?itok=ph8Brpeh\" width=\"752\" height=\"423\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\n<button class=\"video-embed-field-lazy-play\"></button>\n</div>\n\n        \n            </figure>    \n  </div>\n\n    \n  ","modules":{"0":{"title":"First year","content":"\n       <span class=\"moduletab-label printonly\">First year</span>\n    <p>\n     \n    </p>\n\n    \n    <p>\n      </p><div class=\"paragraph paragraph--type--ug-course-structure-module-block\">\n         \n\n      <p>         </p><p>Core modules:</p>\n\n     <p></p>\n\n      <dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion ugtext\">      \n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Fundamentals of Physics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>This module introduces the fundamentals of University Physics that are built on in later years of study.&nbsp; This includes the development of data analysis skills, laboratory skills, scientific report writing and communication along with the ability to analyse physics problems and solve them using pen and paper, experiment and computer programming.

It includes discussions framed by the book `Sustainable Energy without the Hot Air' by D MacKay and will cover current energy requirements and what energy could potentially be provided by the various forms of renewable energy. The course will commence with a discussion of the basic physics of energy, power and work and the conversion of energy from one form to another. We examine in detail the history of global energy useage and how we produce and use energy in the UK. We will then explore the impacts that this energy use has on the biosphere and climate and the public perception of such processes. The course will then focus on the energy contenet of objects and processes we take for granted and will then move on to means by which we can produce energy using renewable technologies, such as wind, wave, solar, biofuels etc. We will also examine nuclear (fusion and fission) energy and will discuss their principles and practical implementation. Finally, we will consider solutions to our energy needs, including transportation, energy conservation, carbon capture and geoengineering.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">10 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Introduction to Optics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>This module introduces the foundations of classical optics. In the Autumn semester, starting with Fermat’s Principle of Least Time, we derive Snell’s law and the working of lenses in geometrical optics. We give a quantitative description of telescopes and microscopes. We explore the limits of geometrical optics and show that a wave theory of optics is needed to explain phenomena like diffraction and interference. We will briefly touch the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the Michelson-Morley interferometer that is used in gravitational wave detection. <br>\n<br>\nIn the Spring semester we explore the electromagnetic nature of light, and present the polarisation (linear, circular, and elliptical). We introduce the concept of coherence, and use it to make a distinction between coherent light, such as that from a laser, and incoherent light from a light bulb or the Sun. Then we explore the properties of thermal light, including Wien’s law, the Rayleigh-Jeans law, and how Planck reconciled their contradiction. Finally we discuss the implications of the constant speed of light, leading to the Lorentz transformations and the relativity of simultaneity.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">10 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            </dl>      \n      </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n\n    \n  "},"1":{"title":"Second year","content":"\n       <span class=\"moduletab-label printonly\">Second year</span>\n    <p>\n     \n    </p>\n\n    \n    <p>\n      </p><div class=\"paragraph paragraph--type--ug-course-structure-module-block\">\n         \n\n      <p>         </p><p>Core modules:</p>\n\n     <p></p>\n\n      <dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion ugtext\">      \n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Special Relativity &amp; Subatomic Physics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>Special relativity is a key foundation of modern physics, particularly in the contexts of particle physics and astrophysics where E = mc2 and relativistic speeds are crucial concepts.

In addition, living biological matter is driven out of equilibrium due to internal biochemical sources of energy. Mathematical models and modern advanced experimental techniques are revealing the physical principles underpinning the biological world and the technological possibilities of complex soft materials.Much recent progress in soft matter and biology has been made thanks to the advent of advanced experimental&nbsp; techniques which we will show are based on elegant physical principles. We will also study the physical principles underpinning the behaviour of complex soft matter and biological materials. We will describe phase transitions in multiple soft matter systems by calculating free energies. We will use random walk models to describe the shape of polymer molecules and the Brownian motion of colloids. We will also study the dynamics of polymers and the kinetics of polymerisation. We will then consider how polymerisation of protein filaments and action of molecular motors can generate forces in biological cells. This will involve us introducing concepts of systems that are in equilibrium versus out of equilibrium. Using a mathematical&nbsp; framework we can describe behaviour at different length scales for example from the cytoskeleton to tissues, bacteria colonies and flocking.

Finally, we examine space time in the vicinity of the event horizon, the geometry of a non-spinning black hole, and the geometry of wormholes.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">10 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Introduction to Cosmology</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>The module will cover advanced astrophysics topics involving observations and theory of star and planet formation, plus the evolution of low, intermediate and high mass single stars, close binary evolution including their end states (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes), supernovae and gamma ray bursts.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">10 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Quantum Optics and Quantum Computing</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>Quantum computing is introduced through the fundamental concepts of quantum gates and circuits before moving to cover more advanced topics such as quantum programming, quantum algorithms and quantum error correction. These concepts are then applied by studying how programming quantum circuits can be done using cloud computers (e.g. using openQASM format) and the implementation of quantum algorithms (including examples) and quantum error correction using stabiliser formalism and graph states and quantum error correction codes.<br>\n<br>\nThe second part of the module covers quantum optics and quantum optical applications at the forefront of current research in the field. This includes topics such as weak and strong coupling of dipole sources in a cavity, single photon sources, protocols of quantum optical communications and linear optics computation. The module then progresses to quantum optical applications. Cavity electrodynamics is studied in the regimes of strong and weak coupling of matter excitations to the electromagnetic field in optical microstructures. This will lead to the physics of highly efficient single photon devices necessary for linear optics quantum computation. The effects of entanglement and quantum teleportation will be also considered.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">15 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            </dl>      \n      </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n\n    \n  "}}},{"title":"Accounting and Financial Management and Economics","lastUpdated":"2023-04-03T06:53:50+0100","ucasCode":"NL41","year":"2023-24","starts":" September","entryRequirements":{"standard":{"grades":"AAB","extras":"The A Level entry requirements for this course are:<br>","body":"<p><strong class=\"course-ereq-panel__qualification-name\">A Levels + additional qualifications</strong> ABB + A in a social science related EPQ; ABB + A in Core Maths</p>\n                          <p><strong class=\"course-ereq-panel__qualification-name\">International Baccalaureate</strong> 34</p>\n                          <p><strong class=\"course-ereq-panel__qualification-name\">BTEC Extended Diploma</strong> DDD in a relevant subject.

In addition there is examination of a range of accounting standards and underpinning rationales, a review of the major conceptual debates currently preoccupying both accountants and standard-setters, and an exploration of the practical problems associated with the reporting of the results of limited companies and groups.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Intermediate Management Accounting</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>This unit builds on the basic skills acquired in MGT102, viewing the management accountant as an important internal corporate communicator and provider of information for management decision and control purposes. Particular emphasis is placed on the management accountant's various methods of analysing and presenting different kinds of information, drawn from both internal and external sources. The unit distinguishes between the provision of management accounting services at policy, executive and operational levels. On the basis of this distinction, the management accountant is seen as centrally involved in the evaluation and implementation of alternative courses of action in organisations. The unit also examines the development of management accounting techniques in processes of sustainable organisational performance appraisal, analysis and reporting and considers such as strategic marketing, corporate social responsibility and ethics. Finally, the unit considers the developing contribution to be made by management accountants in the creation, evaluation and control of sustainable organisations.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            </dl>      \n      </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n\n    \n    <p>\n      </p><div class=\"paragraph paragraph--type--ug-course-structure-module-block\">\n         \n\n      <p>         </p><p>Core economics module:</p>\n\n     <p></p>\n\n      <dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion ugtext\">      \n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Statistics and Econometrics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>This module introduces dual honours economics students to Statistics and Econometrics and in particular how they are used in economics, to investigate economic relationships and to test economic theories.

In particular, key Sheffield Graduate Attributes you will develop are: (i) Translating knowledge - you will take the theories and techniques learned in your earlier core modules, and apply them to economic issues, problems and challenges raised and discussed in your applied modules. (ii) Critical thinking - you will need to critically appraise, analyse and interpret the evidence that you research on the economic issues you are considering from your applied modules, in order to be able to offer conclusions and recommendations. (iii) Communication - you will need to communicate your ideas, findings and conclusions using a variety of communication methods, that could be appropriate for different circustances, for example a formal report, a blog report for non-specialists, an oral presentation etc.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            </dl>      \n      </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n\n    \n    <p>\n      </p><div class=\"paragraph paragraph--type--ug-course-structure-module-block\">\n         \n\n      <p>         </p><p>Core accounting and financial management modules:</p>\n\n     <p></p>\n\n      <dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion ugtext\">      \n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Advances in Financial Accounting</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>The module follows on from the financial accounting modules taken at levels one and two.

An audit is the independent examination of, and expression of an opinion on, the financial statements of an enterprise. Audit has crucial roles to play in the processes of corporate and social governance, relating especially to the transmission of information to financial markets and individual/groups to whom organisations are accountable. In the 'audit society', the meaning of audit has broadened to embrace diverse forms of inspection and non-financial performance reporting.

Each year a company case will be chosen to reflect contemporary themes and issues in the global economy, which in the past have included the shareholder value drivers of restructuring in the pharmaceuticals sector, banking after the financial crises, the social and economic effects of private equity takeovers of retails chains and creative accounting practices at large outsourcing firms. <br>\n<br>\nThe course therefore concentrates on developing students' 'grounded knowledge' rather than drawing on abstract or overly prescriptive theories. It is designed to encourage students to develop their own initiative and to 'learn-through-doing', with guidance and support given on how to use the university's extensive suite of databases.

This course will: look at how best should be defined in the context of health care; consider the roles that market forces and governments might play in achieving the sector's objectives; and discuss what information is needed so that resources can be deployed where they will do the most good. The aims of the module are: 1.\tTo enable students to develop a critical understanding of the basis of health economics.<br>\n2. To introduce students to the health economists' toolkit, the ways in which it can be used in to inform health care resource allocation, and its limitations.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Economic Analysis of Inequality and Poverty</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>This module will cover the economic theories used for the analysis of inequality and poverty. <br>\nThe theories will be backed by evidence from both the developed and the developing countries. The module starts off by a discussion of issues around measurement of inequality and poverty; the different measures that are used and the inherent assumptions behind these measures. We then move on to explain the existing global trends in inequality and poverty. Different theories are used to explain these trends; for example: role of human capital, poverty traps etc. Finally we discuss the policy response of different countries to address the issues of inequality and poverty, drawing on the specific examples of welfare programmes in the developed countries and the conditional cash transfers in the developing countries.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Economics of Race and Gender</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>The Economics of Race and Gender first presents an overview of differential outcomes by gender and ethnicity in the UK labour market and discusses the possible drivers of these differences.

The module ends with a discussion of the interplay between economics and psychology as a means to better understand when and why discrimination occurs.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Behavioural Economics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>Standard economic models can successfully model human behaviour. However, the strong assumptions required of economic actors in those models will make systematic mispredictions in some contexts. Behavioural economics tries to overcome the systematic mispredictions by adopting non-standard assumptions, often inspired by insights from other disciplines. The module will discuss empirical evidence that underpins these non-standard assumptions, and will reflect on how insights from behavioural economics can be relevant in real life.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">Environmental Economics</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>Economic choices shape nature just as nature can shape our choices. This module provides students with the opportunity to apply economic concepts and methods to issues related to the use and management of the environment and natural resources. The module explores issues, arguments and analysis of market failure in the protection of the environment. It also offers public policy responses to issues of sustainability and climate change.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            \n          \n          <dt class=\"standalone-accordion\">The Economics of Innovation</dt>\n          <dd class=\"active\">\n                        \n<div>\n   \n      <p>The aim of this module is to provide an overview of the economics of innovation. The module will study firms' incentives to invest in innovation and the resulting policy implications. In this module you will build on and expand your knowledge of microeconomics. Topics will include the relationship between market structure and innovation, the role of firm cooperation and the effects of mergers on innovative activities. The module will also look at the role of intellectual property rights / patent systems and policy interventions. As many innovations in recent years are in the area of digitalisation and platform ecosystems, the module will also provide a short introduction to the economics of platform markets.</p>\n      <strong class=\"ugcredits\">20 credits</strong>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n                      </dd>                     \n\n            </dl>      \n      </div>\n\n    <p></p>\n\n    \n  "}}}]
